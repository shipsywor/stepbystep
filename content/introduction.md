| 0    | (Trigun)            | Vash the Stampede | When something is gained, something is lost. It's difficult to live after something like that. What is lost will never return. Important things, irreplaceable things. But what is needed to keep those things is in the firm will, packed into one bullet. Man knows... he knows that nothing will begin unless he speaks, and that nothing will change unless he moves. |

Love has to be nurtured if it's going to last. If you want to be with someone forever, you need to put effort into the relationship... Great, now I'm talking cliches.                                                                                                                                 |

You may feel guilt over having run away, but what about what happened here? The people you've met? How's it all been? Were they negative experiences? It's ok to run away in order to live. It really is ok. You're different from farm animals who have nowhere to run.                                                                    |

| 12  | (Psycho-Pass Extended Edition)                   | Makishima Shougo     | Clausewitz, he pointed out that no matter how carefully one plans, on the battlefield, even the smallest of details can cause setbacks. Regardless of how well-thought it is, armchair strategizing only works in the realm of theory. Unexpected troubles, or uncontrollable factors such as weather. Operations face those sorts of troubles. They are the cause of strife on the battlefield. |

| 14  | (Detective Conan)                                | Ran Mouri            | Courage is a word of justice. It means the quality of mind that enables one to face apprehension with confidence and resolution. It is not right to use it as an excuse to kill someone.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| 79 | (Uchouten Kazoku) | Yasaburou Shimogamo | When saying good-bye to this world, our great father split his blood into four: the eldest inherited only his sense of responsibility, the second eldest inherited only his easygoing personality, the youngest inherited only his innocence, and me, well, I inherited only his idiocy. What held us diverse brothers together was the love of our mother, deeper than the sea, and the farewell we bid our great father. Sometimes, one profound separation can unite the ones left behind. |
