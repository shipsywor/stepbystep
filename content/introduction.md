It's difficult to live after something like that. What is lost will never return. Important things, irreplaceable things. But what is needed to keep those things is in the firm will, packed into one bullet. Man knows... he knows that nothing will begin unless he speaks, and that nothing will change unless he moves.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Without a means to cross the ocean, we can only stand and watch keeping the words we desperately want to express inside.

You may feel guilt over having run away, but what about what happened here? The people you've met? How's it all been? Were they negative experiences? It's ok to run away in order to live.
